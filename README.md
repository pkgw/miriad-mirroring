MIRIAD Mirroring Tools
======================

These scripts are used to export the MIRIAD source code from
various organization's version control systems into Git. Instead
of worrying about these, you should probably check out the end
results:

* the [ATNF MIRIAD mirror](http://github.com/pkgw/atnf-miriad)
* the [CARMA MIRIAD mirror](http://github.com/pkgw/carma-miriad)
